# Detailed Multiplayer Word Game Implementation Plan

## Overview
We will implement a Wordle-style multiplayer word game optimized for Android devices. The game will feature real-time multiplayer interactions, a game board to view guesses, an input form for submitting words, and a scoreboard to track player scores. The solution will be built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS with in-memory state management and polling for real-time updates.

## 1. Define TypeScript Interfaces
- **File:** src/lib/gameTypes.ts  
  - Create and export the following interfaces:
    - `Player`: { id: string; name: string; score: number; }
    - `Guess`: { playerId: string; word: string; timestamp: number; }
    - `GameState`: { guesses: Guess[]; players: Player[]; currentWord?: string; status: 'waiting' | 'in-progress' | 'finished'; }
  - Ensure all types are properly documented for clarity.

## 2. Main Game Page Setup
- **File:** src/app/game/page.tsx  
  - Import React, the custom hook `useGameState`, and the UI components: `GameBoard`, `WordInput`, and `ScoreBoard`.
  - Create a responsive layout using Tailwind CSS classes (e.g., flex, grid, responsive breakpoints).  
  - Implement state management to display loading messages, error information, or the populated game state.
  - Use proper error boundaries for any asynchronous operations.

## 3. GameBoard Component
- **File:** src/components/GameBoard.tsx  
  - Accept a prop (e.g., `gameState: GameState`) which includes an array of guesses.  
  - Render a grid where each row represents a guess. Use Tailwind CSS for styling (e.g., spacing, borders).
  - Display a message when no guesses have been made.
  - Validate passed props and include fallback UI in case of errors.

## 4. WordInput Component
- **File:** src/components/WordInput.tsx  
  - Render a form with a controlled `<input type="text">` element tailored for mobile touch interaction.
  - Validate user input to allow only alphabetic characters and enforce a fixed word length (e.g., 5 letters).
  - On form submit, send a POST request to `/api/game` with JSON payload `{ guess: string, player: string }` using `fetch`.
  - Provide inline error messages on invalid input and clear the input upon successful submission.
  - Use try/catch to handle network errors and provide user feedback.

## 5. ScoreBoard Component
- **File:** src/components/ScoreBoard.tsx  
  - Accept a prop for the array of players from the game state.
  - Render a styled vertical list where each player’s name and score is shown.
  - Use Tailwind CSS typography and spacing classes to ensure a modern, clean look.

## 6. API Route for Game State
- **File:** src/app/api/game/route.ts  
  - Implement the GET method:
    - Return the current in-memory game state (GameState JSON object).
  - Implement the POST method:
    - Validate the incoming request body for required fields (`guess`, `player`).
    - Update the in-memory game state: Append new guesses and update the player’s score.
    - Use try/catch for error handling and return appropriate HTTP status codes (200 on success, 400 for invalid input, 500 for server errors).
  - Ensure JSON responses and proper Content-Type headers are set.

## 7. Custom Hook: useGameState
- **File:** src/hooks/useGameState.ts  
  - Create a hook that uses `useEffect` to poll the `/api/game` endpoint at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 seconds).
  - Use `useState` to store game state, loading state, and any errors.
  - Ensure the polling is cleaned up on component unmount with a proper cleanup function.
  - Return an object with game state, loading, and error flags.

## 8. Update Global Styles (if required)
- **File:** src/app/globals.css  
  - Add any additional Tailwind CSS utility classes needed for spacing, layout, or typography to ensure consistency across the game components.
  - Verify that responsiveness and touch-friendly design are maintained.

## 9. Testing and Error Handling
- **Manual Testing:**  
  - Use mobile device emulation in the browser to confirm the responsive layout and touch controls.
- **API Endpoint Testing via Curl:**
  - Test GET:  
    ```bash
    curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/game -w "\nHTTP: %{http_code}\n"
    ```
  - Test POST:  
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localho
    st:3000/api/game \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"guess": "HELLO", "player": "Player1"}' -w "\nHTTP: %{http_code}\n"
    ```
- Validate that error messages and fallback UIs are displayed appropriately in the UI if API calls fail.

## Summary
- Defined TypeScript interfaces in src/lib/gameTypes.ts for consistent game state management.
- Created a responsive game page (src/app/game/page.tsx) that assembles GameBoard, WordInput, and ScoreBoard components.
- Developed GameBoard, WordInput, and ScoreBoard with modern, touch-friendly UI using Tailwind CSS.
- Implemented an API route (src/app/api/game/route.ts) for multiplayer game state with proper error handling.
- Created a custom hook (src/hooks/useGameState.ts) for polling and syncing game state.
- Ensured robust error handling, form validation, and real-time updates for the multiplayer experience.
